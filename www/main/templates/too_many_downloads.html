Bitparcel | Too Many Downloads
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<div id="too-many-downloads">
    The file
    <span id="filename-too-many">{{ row.filename }}</span>
    has already been downloaded 5 times.
    We're really sorry about this, but keeping the number of times a file can
    be downloaded to 5 allows us to keep bitparcel free.
</div>
